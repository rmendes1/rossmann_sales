# **Description**
_This is a fictional business case_

Rossmann's CFO has done a meeting with all store managers and asked that each of them brought a daily sales forecast of the next 6 weeks.
The CFO needs to make an investiment for stores rebuilding but he does not know how much money he should invest. Therefore, he required
a forecast to know how much the stores will sell and have an idea of the quantity to be invested.

Given the business situation, an important question must be answered:

1. How much revenue will the stores make in the next 6 weeks?

# **Dataset**

- The dataset for this project has been extracted from Kaggle's Rossmann Prediction Sales' competition. 
- This dataset an all the pieces of information regarding it can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales

# Steps
In this project we will follow the CRISP-DM Proccess of Development, which consists in:
- **Business understanding**
  - _What is the motivation?_
  - _What is the problem cause?_
  - _What is the solution format?_
- **Data collection (via Kaggle)**
- **Data Cleaning**
  - Descriptive Statistics Analysis: Mean, Median, Max, Min, Standard Deviation, Inter-Quartile Range, Skewness, Kurtosis.  
  - Feature Engineering: To obtain new values that are required for better inferences based on the previous values obtained.
  - Data Filtering/Selection: To select the rows, columns, and data ranges that are not relevant for the model or are outside the business scope.
- **Data Exploration**
  - _What variables affect this fenomena?_
    - Univariate Analysis
    - Bivariate Analysis
    - Multivariate Analysis
- **Data Preparation/Modelling**
  - Rescaling: To normalize all data (numerical and categorical) to the same scale for the ML Model to be trained. 
  - Variable Filtering/Selection: To select the variables that are more relevant for the prediction model. **Boruta Feature Selector** was used here to define the best variables.
- **ML Algorithms implementation**
  - Set the models to be used and calculate their performances for this specific problem. 
- **Hyperparameter Finetuning**
  - To find the conjunct of parameters that maximize the model learning process.
- **Interpretation of the ML Algorithm and Error translation**
  - To estimate if the model is accurate enough and tell how much revenue it will bring to the company.  
- **Project Deploy on /Heroku Cloud**
  - To publish the model in a cloud environment so others can have access to it.   
- **Creation of a Telegram Bot**
  - To enable the stores revenue query at any time using your Telegram account.
